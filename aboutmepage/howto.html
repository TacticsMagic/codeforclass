    <h1>
        How I made this webpage
    </h1>
    <h2>
        What HTML did I use?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have learned to use the &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; tags in order to write out the paragraphs that you see here.
        The &lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; tags were used to create the headers you see at the top of this webpage.
        &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tags were used to provide links to the About Me page and How To page.
        The &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; tags are used to create unordered lists and while &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; makes ordered lists.
        I used the unordered lists in order to organize the things that I like because from a design perspective it does not give. The &lt;img src=&quot;&quot;&gt; tag is used to put in the images that
        you see on the about me webpage. I used the &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; tags to divide up the code in order to style them with CSS. I used the &lt;br&gt;
        tag to create space between two elements to keep the page from being all compressed.
    </p>
    <h2>
        What CSS did I use?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I was able to style the HTML by linking it with the external stylesheet with the following code &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;aboutme.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;/&gt;
        The navigation bar was styled by selecting .navbar and styled it with background color, borders, and even a sticky position in order to give it more flair.
        When the mouse hovers over the navbar links I made it change from blue to orange with the selector .navbar a:hover. I was able to align the text to the center by using the body selector and used
        text-align: center; to center the text. I used the font-size property to make the text bigger and more legible. I was able to put two pictures side by side by making .line as my selector and used
        display: inline-block; to put two pictures side by side to make it look neater as you can see down below. I used the border property to separate elements from each other and make it neater.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Sample Code
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Images

    <div class="">

            <img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/a5200ff8939402e4e2bbda3a8107d2b1/tenor.gif">
        <p>
            The code works like this 
            &lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tenor.com/images/91cf13a0f078865480dfb64bc514250e/tenor.gif&quot;&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            This line of code requires the "img" tag and the source of the image which is the URL of the image.
        </p>
    <h3>
        Links
    </h3>
        <p>
            If you want to put in links on a webpage, the code below shows how you can put links
        </p>
        <p>
             &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KonoSuba&quot;&gt; 
             This line of code requires an "a href" tag and the URL of the website along with clickable text
        </p>
        <p>
            But now that is out of the way one of the images above has a link hidden in it. Can You Find It? There are also other links hidden throughout
            the About Me and the How To page. Can You Find Them All? Let's make this a Game shall we?

        How to make a navbar
    </h3>
    <ul class="navex">
        <a href="https://preview.c9users.io/tacticsmagic/codeforclass/aboutmepage/aboutme.html?_c9_id=livepreview1&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io">
                <li>
                    About Me
                </li>
            </a>
            <a href="https://preview.c9users.io/tacticsmagic/codeforclass/aboutmepage/howto.html?_c9_id=livepreview2&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io">

                    How To Page
                </li>
            </a>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The navbar in its simplest form is basically an unordered list with links in the text
    </p>
    <p>
        But in order to make it look like an actual navbar you will need CSS to style it. If you want the options to be side by side
        you must use the property inline-block then you can use properties such as border to give the navbar borders or color to change the 
        color of the text. If you really want to get advanced, you can select a:hover to make the navbar change color once the mouse hovers over the links.
    </p>
    <p>
        And that covers all the complicated elements in my website
